    "# The Snake Cube\n",
    "\n",
    "The snake cube looks like a Rubik's cube, in being 3 x 3 x 3. \n",
    "\n",
    "But the color coding doesn't matter, even if a handsome two-tone wood scheme is employed, as in this case. It ravels and unravels. \n",
    "\n",
    "When fully coiled, it's a cube. Unraveled, it's a necklace of sorts, with \"beads\" consisting of smaller cube-trains, two and three long. The smaller cubes rotate, such that even if hitched together, many circuitous routes are implied.\n",
    "\n",
    "I'd somewhat mistaken it for a Rubik's cube myself. The puzzle came to me in a kind of cargo cult care package, from the CogSec folks, over the holidays. I  sometimes have a way of proudly displaying a thing (say a book) without fully realizing what the thing is (or contains). So I was as surprised as anyone when the \"Rubik's Cube\" went into necklace mode and resisted my attempts to twist it back into cubehood.\n",
    "\n",
    "Ryan, my houseguest at the time, a visiting Cascadian scholar, fiddled with it some, as did Dr. David DiNucci. \n",
    "\n",
    "However, the latter, being a puzzle-meister and pro programmer, went further, and wrote down the beed sequence: 3 - 3 - 3 - 2 - 2 - 3... and so on. \n",
    "\n",
    "With only that information, he was confidant he could \"write a computer program\" that would solve the puzzle. And that's exactly what he did. Here is his source code:"
