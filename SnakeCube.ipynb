    "# The Snake Cube\n",
    "\n",
    "The snake cube looks like a Rubik's cube, in being 3 x 3 x 3. \n",
    "\n",
    "But the color coding doesn't matter, even if a handsome two-tone wood scheme is employed, as in this case. It ravels and unravels. \n",
    "\n",
    "When fully coiled, it's a cube. Unraveled, it's a necklace of sorts, with \"beads\" consisting of smaller cube-trains, two and three long. The smaller cubes rotate, such that even if hitched together, many circuitous routes are implied.\n",
    "\n",
    "I'd somewhat mistaken it for a Rubik's cube myself. The puzzle came to me in a kind of cargo cult care package, from the CogSec folks, over the holidays. I  sometimes have a way of proudly displaying a thing (say a book) without fully realizing what the thing is (or contains). So I was as surprised as anyone when the \"Rubik's Cube\" went into necklace mode and resisted my attempts to twist it back into cubehood.\n",
    "\n",
    "Ryan, my houseguest at the time, a visiting Cascadian scholar, fiddled with it some, as did Dr. David DiNucci. \n",
    "\n",
    "However, the latter, being a puzzle-meister and pro programmer, went further, and wrote down the beed sequence: 3 - 3 - 3 - 2 - 2 - 3... and so on. \n",
    "\n",
    "With only that information, he was confidant he could \"write a computer program\" that would solve the puzzle. And that's exactly what he did. Here is his source code:"

    "/******************************************************************************\\\n",
    " snake.c  Solve the snake:\n",
    "    \"The snake\" is 27 (wooden) cubes, each of them except 2 ends\n",
    "    connected to 2 neighboring cubes, the two ends to only one.\n",
    "    Each connection is face to face, and can each be rotated.\n",
    "    The result is that there are straight-line sequences joined\n",
    "    at right angles in 3 dimensions, each \"corner cube\" belonging\n",
    "    to the sequence both before and after it.  The specific lengths\n",
    "    of these straight-line sequences, in order from one end to the\n",
    "    other, and thereby double-counting the corner cubes, is:\n",
    "           3, 3, 3, 3, 2, 2, 2, 3, 3, 2, 2, 3, 2, 3, 2, 2, 3\n",
    "\n",
    "    The goal is to manipulate the snake into a 3x3 \"big cube\" while\n",
    "    preserving these constraints.\n",
    "\n",
    "    This program uses a brute force approach. Whenever we establish\n",
    "    a location for one of those segments, we'll need to look in all 4\n",
    "    perpendicular directions from its end, and not only try to put the\n",
    "    next segment there (if there's room, and no other segment obstructs\n",
    "    it), but also do the same at the end of THAT segment, etc. If/when\n",
    "    we can't move forward this way, we need to backtrack to the last\n",
    "    decision point - that is, the last segment where there's a\n",
    "    perpendicular direction we haven't tried, and then try that. We can\n",
    "    envision all these choices as a big decision tree, and can use a\n",
    "    stack - specifically, the function call stack - to keep track of\n",
    "    where we are, moving away from the root (to try more segments and\n",
    "    directions) by calling more functions, or backtracking back towards\n",
    "        the root (when failing to proceed) by returning from those functions.\n",
    "\n",
    "    We'll cheat a bit at the beginning. Since the first 4 segments in\n",
    "    the snake are 3 long, we know that the first segment must end up\n",
    "    along a corner of the \"big cube\". So instead of starting out by\n",
    "    trying all kinds of directions for the first segment, we'll just\n",
    "    start at a corner of the big cube and try (and succeed) to lay the\n",
    "    first segment down from there.\n",
    "\n",
    "    A note about \"directions\": A direction will designate both an axis in\n",
    "    the big (3x3x3 array) cube (x, y, or z, which correspond roughly\n",
    "    to dimensions 0, 1, and 2) and whether we're moving in a\n",
    "    negative or positive direction along that axis. It is easiest for\n",
    "    us to consider this as a unit vector in 3D, that is, a 3-element 1D\n",
    "    array (called offset) where all the elements are 0 except one which\n",
    "    is either a +1 or -1. We'll use a separate variable, dim, to designate\n",
    "    which of the elements of offset is non-zero.\n",
    "\n",
    "    So, primary data structures are:\n",
    "        int cube[3][3][3] represents the big cube, non-zero element\n",
    "             means it's full (we'll put (segment # + 1) in there).\n",
    "        int offset[3] and int dim represent a direction (as above).\n",
    "        int snake[] is the sequence of segment lengths in the snake.\n",
    "        int pos[3] is coordinate of a position in cube.\n",
    "        int segment is the index into snake of segment we're working on.\n",
    "\n",
    "    The two principal functions we'll use are:\n",
    "        int go_dir(dim, offset, cube, pos, segment)\n",
    "            Tries to put segment into cube starting at\n",
    "              pos in direction offset (in dimension dim).\n",
    "            Returns a 1 if it succeeds (ie. there's room, it's open,\n",
    "              and all following segments also fit) or a 0 if not.\n",
    "\n",
    "        int find_new_dir(cube, segment, pos, not_dim)\n",
    "            Tries every direction (which is not along dimension\n",
    "               not_dim) in cube for segment, starting at pos. \n",
    "            Returns a 1 if it finds one (that works all the way\n",
    "               from here on out) or a 0 if not.\n",
