    "A typical table structure:  main table has one line per polyhedron, which points one-to-many to its faces, which in turn point one-to-many to the vertex vectors each face has, going around.  Edges distill from faces, e.g. if we have face ('A', 'B', 'C') then we have edges 'AB', 'BC', 'AC'.  To keep edge names unique, we tend to alphabetize them, such that 'CA' and 'AC' don't register separately. Just use 'AC'.\n",
